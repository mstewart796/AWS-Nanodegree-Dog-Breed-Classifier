Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: None of the models were able to identify the correct breed (dachshund). Resnet and vgg both predicted "eskimo dog, husky".
Alexnet - > malamute, malemute, alaskan malamute
resnet - > eskimo dog, husky
vgg - > eskimo dog, husky


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I would choose alexnet. None of the 3 architectures were able to correctly predict the breed (dachshund), however only alexnet correctly reported this error with the following results:
pct_match has percentage of 25.0%
pct_correct_dogs has percentage of 100.0%
pct_correct_breed has percentage of 0.0%
pct_correct_notdogs has percentage of 100.0%

Both resnet and vgg reported 100% accuracy on dog breed. Additionally, alexnet had the fastest compute time of 0:0:0 compared to resnet's 0:0:1 and vgg's 0:0:4.
